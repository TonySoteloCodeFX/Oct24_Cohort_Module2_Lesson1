<h3>3.Arithmetic Operations in Daily Life</h3>

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with basic arithmetic operations and understand how they can be applied in everyday situations.

<h5>Task 1: Grocery Store Math</h5> Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. For example, what would be the cost of bread, peanut butter, and jelly be? Prices don't need to be realistic!

<h5>Task 2: Bank Interest</h5> If you have a savings account with a particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, calculate the total amount in your account after a year. So if you had $10,000 at a 7% interest write code that would tell us the amount at the end of the year. For the example the expected outcome would be $10,700.
